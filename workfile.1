This  is my workfile, workfile1, the Nortorious Workfile.
HOT problem with the website detected that Conor needs to fix!

This workfile's favorite MMA fighter is The Notorious Conor McGregor....

THIS LINE:  This line was added in branch iss53 because there was a problem
and the Notorious had to fix it.  He leaves this wisdom:

"Precision beats power.  Timing beats speed."

And that's it!  A five round, unamious decision to Conor.
